# Open By-laws microsite

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/laws-africa/openbylaws-wc033.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.com/laws-africa/openbylaws-wc033)

This is an openbylaws.org.za microsite.

The only thing it does is run the build process from the [openbylaws.org.za's microsite repo](https://github.com/laws-africa/openbylaws-microsite),
configured for za-wc033. The results are force-pushed to this repo's gh-pages branch, and deployed as a GitHub pages website.

See [.travis.yml](.travis.yml) for the details.

## Building locally

If you want to build the microsite locally, you're in the wrong place. Instead, you want the openbylaws.org.za microsite repo.
